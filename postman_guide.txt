# Simple Guide: Testing with Postman

Yes! You should absolutely use Postman to test the **RAG API** part of your project. It's much easier to see the results there.

### 1. Prerequisite: Start the RAG API
The RAG API runs on a different "profile". Open your terminal and run:
```powershell
docker-compose --profile rag up -d
```
This starts the service on port **8001**.

### 2. How to use Postman (Step-by-Step)

#### A. Check if it's working (Health Check)
1. Open Postman and click **New** -> **HTTP Request**.
2. Select **GET** and enter: `http://localhost:8001/health`
3. Click **Send**. You should see `"status": "healthy"`.

#### B. Upload a PDF (Index Document)
1. Create a new request.
2. Select **POST** and enter: `http://localhost:8001/index_pdf`
3. Go to the **Body** tab, select **form-data**.
4. In the **Key** column, type `file`. Change the dropdown from "Text" to **File**.
5. In the **Value** column, click "Select Files" and pick a PDF.
6. Click **Send**. It will analyze the PDF and store it in the database.

#### C. Ask a Question (Query RAG)
1. Create a new request.
2. Select **POST** and enter: `http://localhost:8001/query_rag`
3. Go to the **Body** tab, select **raw**, and choose **JSON** in the dropdown.
4. Paste this simple code:
```json
{
  "question": "What is the main topic of the document?",
  "session_id": "default",
  "top_k": 5
}
```
5. Click **Send**. The AI will read your document and give you the answer!

### Summary Tips:
- **Port 8001** is for the API (Postman).
- **Port 8000** is where the interactive terminal agent runs.
- If you get an error, make sure `docker-compose --profile rag up -d` is finished starting.
