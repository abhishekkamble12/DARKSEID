# Darksied Agent Project - Sample Test Document

This is a sample document to test the Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) capabilities of the Darksied Multi-Agent System.

## Project Overview
The Darksied project is a sophisticated multi-agent system built using LangGraph and LangChain. It features several specialized agents:
- **Supervisor Agent:** The brains of the operation that routes queries.
- **Research Agent:** Uses Tavily for web searches and DSA concept explanations.
- **Examiner Agent:** Generates quizzes and assessments for users.
- **RAG Agent:** Searches through uploaded documents like this one.
- **Chat Agent:** Handles general greetings and conversation.

## Tech Stack
The project uses the following technologies:
- **Language:** Python 3.11
- **Vector DB:** Qdrant (for efficient similarity search)
- **Database:** PostgreSQL (for conversation memory)
- **Containerization:** Docker & Docker Compose
- **LLM:** Google Gemini (via LangChain Google GenAI)

## How to Test
To test the RAG functionality, you can ask questions like:
- "What agents are part of the Darksied system?"
- "Which vector database does this project use?"
- "What is the role of the Examiner Agent?"
