# Hugging Face Dependencies for Local Quiz Generation
# ==================================================
# Install with: pip install -r requirements-hf.txt
#
# Note: For GPU support, install PyTorch with CUDA first:
#   pip install torch torchvision torchaudio --index-url https://download.pytorch.org/whl/cu121
#
# For CPU-only (slower but works anywhere):
#   pip install torch torchvision torchaudio --index-url https://download.pytorch.org/whl/cpu

# Core HuggingFace libraries
transformers>=4.40.0
accelerate>=0.30.0
bitsandbytes>=0.43.0  # For 4-bit quantization (Linux/WSL recommended)

# PyTorch - uncomment ONE of the following based on your system:
# torch>=2.2.0  # Basic (will auto-detect CUDA if available)

# Sentencepiece for Gemma tokenizer
sentencepiece>=0.1.99

# Optional: For better performance
# safetensors>=0.4.0
# optimum>=1.18.0  # For additional optimizations

# Note on bitsandbytes:
# - Works best on Linux or WSL2
# - Windows native support is experimental
# - For Windows without WSL, you may need to compile from source or use CPU mode
