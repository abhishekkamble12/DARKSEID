# HOW TO TEST YOUR PROJECT

Follow these steps to test the Darksied Multi-Agent System:

### 1. Start the services
Make sure you are in the D:\AISENSE_PROJ\Darksied directory and run:
```powershell
docker-compose up -d
```
(I see this is already running in your terminal!)

### 2. Enter the Agent Container
To interact with the agent directly, run:
```powershell
docker-compose exec agent python project.py
```
This will start the interactive session. You can type your questions there.

### 3. Test RAG (Document Search)
The system has a RAG agent. To test it:
a. Copy the `test_document.txt` I created for you into the `uploads` folder inside the project.
b. In the agent prompt, you can ask questions about the document, such as:
   - "What agents are in this project?"
   - "Tell me about the Examiner Agent."

### 4. Test Research & DSA
The agent can also search the web. Try asking:
- "Find me popular LeetCode problems for Dynamic Programming."
- "Explain the Merge Sort algorithm."

### 5. Check the Database (Optional)
Your conversation memory is stored in PostgreSQL. You can check it with:
```powershell
docker-compose exec postgres psql -U user -d agent_db -c "SELECT * FROM checkpoints;"
```

### 6. View the Dashboard (Coming soon?)
If you use the `rag-api` profile, you can access the API at http://localhost:8001.
To start with RAG API:
```powershell
docker-compose --profile rag up -d
```
